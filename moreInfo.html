          The Gender Digital Divide
        </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
          The Gender Digital Divide is the gap between women and men accessing technology and the internet.
           “A lack of opportunities, skills, and a fear of discrimination,” prevent women from using 
           technology. The Gender Digital Divide is most prominent in less-developed countries. 
           For example, in South Asia, women are 70% less likely to use mobile internet. 
           The reason for such a gap is because of digital literacy. In these countries, people, 
           especially women, are not exposed to digital literacy and avoid technology in fear of, 
           “harassing calls from strangers and fear of identity theft” (Plan International).

          Being able to access and use technology is helpful as 
          “over 90% of jobs worldwide already have a digital component” (Plan International). 
          The Internet can also be a place to voice issues and communicate with others. 
          Teaching digital literacy is important, key topics include reliable sources, social media, 
          cyberbullying, and online safety. Learning Literacy’s goal is to teach young women about 
          technology so they can help close the gender digital divide gap and grow into adults with 
          the knowledge they need to thrive in our technological world.
